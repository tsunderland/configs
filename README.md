# MyConfigs
My vimrc and tmux configs!.

Vimrc - This source uses references from Amir Salihefendic (http://amix.dk) and freecodecamp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vimrc-configuration-guide-customize-your-vim-editor/). 
Tmux.conf - This source uses references from works of Han Boetes (original source missing...oops)

Of coures you need to rename the file and prepend the '.' to the file name when installing these as your configs.

Goodluck!
